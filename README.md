# Steam-Account-generator
This is a script written in python about generating steam accounts.

Version 1 of this script does not support automatic email fetching and solving reCaptcha. The program only inputs data instead of a user and waits for the user to confirm the mail and solve recaptcha on your own.

Generator works on steam regions like Turkey, Argentina, Ukraine, etc.
